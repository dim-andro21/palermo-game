5. Players discuss and vote to eliminate suspects.
6. Game ends when all killers are eliminated (good win) or killers outnumber others (bad win).

## 📳 Notes

* Vibration works on **Android/Chrome**. iOS Safari does **not** support the Vibration API.
* Silent mode on the phone disables vibrations (not a bug, just… your phone being polite 🤷).
* Audio requires user interaction to start (autoplay policy).

## 🧪 The AI Experiment

This whole project is part of a **fun experiment**: the developer (me 🙋) knows very little JavaScript, but with the help of **ChatGPT**, the entire game was designed, implemented, debugged, and polished.

Even this `README.md` is written by AI — so if you spot jokes, emojis, or too much enthusiasm, now you know why. 😎

The idea was simple: *what if I let an AI co-pilot build a complete browser game from scratch?* This repo is the result.

📌 **Why Palermo?** Because the original Android app for this game disappeared, and on iOS it was only available as a paid app. This project is my way of bringing it back for everyone, free and open-source. 🎉

## 🏆 Credits

* Concept: classic **Palermo/Mafia** party game.
* Development: Human curiosity + AI assistance.
